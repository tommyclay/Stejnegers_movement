# Trans-equatorial migration links oceanic frontal habitats across the Pacific Ocean: year-round movements and foraging activity of a small gadfly petrel 

Thomas A. Clay, Michael de L. Brooke

## Overview

The following repository contains codes to derive spatial locations based on light-based geolocation for Stejneger's petrels Pterodroma longirostris, in revision in Marine Biology. DOI: X

We based our process on the manual published by Lisovski et al. (2020) Light-Level Geolocator Analyses: A user’s guide. Journal of Animal Ecology 89:221-236. DOI: 10.1111/1365-2656.13036. https://geolocationmanual.vogelwarte.ch/

Raw light data and twilights, as well as processed geolocator locations, can be viewed and/or downloaded via a Movebank Data Repository: Clay TA, Brooke MdeL. (X).

## General statement (please read before using data)

The archived files (in the repostory listed above) contain data derived from fieldwork on Isla Alejandro Selkirk, Juan Fernández Islands, Chile. We request that you let Tommy Clay (tommy.clay@outlook.com) or Michael Brooke (mb10005@cam.ac.uk) know if you use them, for the following reasons:
- The data are complex and workers who do not know the study species are likely to benefit from advice on interpretation.
- People within the project or collaborators may be analyzing data from this project and it is desirable to prevent duplication of effort.

## Codes
